# ✅ Issues Fixed - MedCore AI

## Date: October 30, 2025

### 🔧 Issues Resolved:

#### 1. **404 Error - Wrong Server Running**
**Problem:** You were running `dpp.py` instead of `app.py`
- `dpp.py` doesn't have the video call/scheduling routes
- This caused 404 errors when trying to access `/api/get_video_call_requests`

**Solution:** 
- Stopped `dpp.py`
- Started `app.py` which has all the new routes
- Server now running at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

#### 2. **Patient AI Not Working**
**Problem:** "Error: Patient API not configured"
- The patient chat was trying to call an external API
- No PATIENT_API_URL was configured in .env

**Solution:**
- Added fallback responses when external API is not configured
- Patient AI now works with built-in health information
- Provides helpful responses for:
  - General health tips ✅
  - When to see a doctor ✅
  - Nutrition advice ✅
  - Exercise recommendations ✅
  - Mental health resources ✅
  - Medication safety ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Keep app.py running** - Don't close the terminal
2. **Use correct URLs** - Always use http://127.0.0.1:5000/...
3. **Test the workflow:**
   - Patient requests video call
   - Doctor sees notification
   - Doctor schedules appointment
   - Patient sees appointment
4. **Try the AI chat** - Now works without external API!

## 📝 Notes:

- Patient AI works offline (no API key needed)

- Not a substitute for medical advice
- For production, configure PATIENT_API_URL for advanced AI
